DynaSLAM is a visual SLAM system that is robust in dynamic scenarios for monocular, stereo and RGB-D configurations. Having a static map of the scene allows inpainting the frame background that has been occluded by such dynamic objects.

We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the [TUM dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) as RGB-D or monocular, and in the [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) as stereo or monocular.

## Getting Started
- Install ORB-SLAM2 prerequisites: C++11 or C++0x Compiler, Pangolin, **OpenCV 2.4.11** and Eigen3  (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2).
- Install boost libraries with the command `sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev`.
- Install python3, keras and tensorflow, and download the `mask_rcnn_coco.h5` model from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases. 
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:BertaBescos/DynaSLAM.git
cd DynaSLAM
```
```
cd DynaSLAM
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
- Place the `mask_rcnn_coco.h5` model in the folder `DynaSLAM/src/python/`.

## RGB-D Example on TUM Dataset
- Download a sequence from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download and uncompress it.

- Associate RGB images and depth images executing the python script [associate.py](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools):

  ```
  python associate.py PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/rgb.txt PATH_TO_SEQUENCE/depth.txt > associations.txt
  ```

- Execute the following command. Change `TUMX.yaml` to TUM1.yaml,TUM2.yaml or TUM3.yaml for freiburg1, freiburg2 and freiburg3 sequences respectively. Change `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER` to the uncompressed sequence folder. Change `ASSOCIATIONS_FILE` to the path to the corresponding associations file.

  ```
  ./Examples/RGB-D/rgbd_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/RGB-D/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER ASSOCIATIONS_FILE (PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/mask) (PATH_TO_OUTPUT)
  ```
  
If `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/mask` and `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` are **not** provided, only the geometrical approach is used to detect dynamic objects. If it finds the computed dynamic masks in `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/mask`, it uses them too.

If `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/mask` is provided, Mask R-CNN is used to segment the potential dynamic content of every frame. These masks are saved in the provided folder `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER/mask`. If this argument is `no_save`, the masks are used but not saved. 

If `PATH_TO_OUTPUT` is provided, the inpainted frames are computed and saved in `PATH_TO_OUTPUT`.

the computed  output will be saved in here. If `PATH_TO_MASKS` exists and contains the corresponding computed masks, they will be used for the system.

## Stereo Example on KITTI Dataset
- Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php 

- Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`to KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11. 
```
./Examples/Stereo/stereo_kitti Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/KITTIX.yaml PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER/dataset/sequences/SEQUENCE_NUMBER
```

## Monocular Example on TUM Dataset
- Download a sequence from http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/download and uncompress it.

- Execute the following command. Change `TUMX.yaml` to TUM1.yaml,TUM2.yaml or TUM3.yaml for freiburg1, freiburg2 and freiburg3 sequences respectively. Change `PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER`to the uncompressed sequence folder.
```
./Examples/Monocular/mono_tum Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Monocular/TUMX.yaml PATH_TO_SEQUENCE_FOLDER
```

## Monocular Example on KITTI Dataset
- Download the dataset (grayscale images) from http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php 

- Execute the following command. Change `KITTIX.yaml`by KITTI00-02.yaml, KITTI03.yaml or KITTI04-12.yaml for sequence 0 to 2, 3, and 4 to 12 respectively. Change `PATH_TO_DATASET_FOLDER` to the uncompressed dataset folder. Change `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` to 00, 01, 02,.., 11. 
```
